                <h2>The Hair Growth Cycle</h2>
                <p>Anagen Phase → Catagen Phase →<br> Telogen Phase → Exogen Phase→<br> Anagen Phase</p>

                <p>Grows 9-13 cm per year, lasts 6-7 years in anagen phase.</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    About 90% of our hair is in this active growing stage. On average, hair grows 9-13 centimeters per year, and this phase usually lasts 6-7 years. But everyone is different. It depends on your genes, nutrition, hormones, and whether you have any injuries or infections.

                    Notice that these are cells that keep dividing and growing. Hair is made of cells, but they are already dead. As the cells mature, they slowly die. The nucleus, cytoplasm, and organelles all disappear. Only keratin is left, keeping the same shape as the cell.

                    After the exogen phase, it will cycle back to anagen. But new hair does not connect to old hair. It just pushes the old hair out. So, how long your hair can grow depends on how much it can grow in one anagen phase.

                    This is the world record for the longest female hair. It was measured in 2004, at 5.63 meters.

                    What about men? Do you think men's hair grows longer or shorter?

                    The longest male hair record is 7.93 meters, from a man in India. But this was only reported in 1949, more than 20 years after he died. So there was no way to verify it.

                    They obviously violate the previous estimation. 7 years times 13cm is only 91cm long.

                    I was curious about this too. Everything I just told you is theory. It's different for everyone.

                    So, many years ago, I decided to stop cutting my hair. I wanted to see how long it could grow.

                    How long do you think my hair is now?

                    I know my hair isn't the longest in the universe, but I'm pretty sure it's the longest in the university.

                    Let me show you.

                    I don't remember when I started growing my hair. And at that time, it was already down to my waist.

                    But about three years ago, I got treatment for a hormonal condition I was born with. I found out it was also affecting my hair growth.

                    My hair doesn't grow faster now, but there is clearly more of it.

                    If I hold my hair like this... around here, I can feel it suddenly gets thinner.

                    So, from here to my scalp, that's how much hair grew in three years.

                    If you look closely at the top of my head, you can see many short hairs, about 5 centimeters long.

                    They match a very sad period in my life, from late January to early June this year.

                    These hairs probably started growing again after mid-June.

                    If you keep your hair long enough, you can explore it and find records of different times in your life. It's very interesting.

                    Wet hair is very heavy and sticky. If you just pull up the hair from your scalp to wash it, it will hurt.

                    So first, I rub shampoo on my hands and wash the scalp at the back of my head.

                    Then I wash from the middle to the ends. If you just rub randomly, it will get very tangled. So I use a grabbing motion, pushing air in and squeezing it out.

                    Finally, I wash the top.

                    I timed it roughly.

                    But my hair washing includes conditioning. After I put on the hair mask, I have to wait 10 minutes before rinsing.

                    So my order is: first wash my face, then wash my hair.

                    Then I dry my hair a little and put on the hair mask.

                    After I pin my hair up on my head, I continue to wash my body and brush my teeth.

                    Finally, I rinse out the hair mask.

                    But the most time-consuming part is drying my hair and untangling it.

                    I read while blow-drying my hair...

                    If someone else is there, I put it close to myself.

                    These prism glasses are really great. I can use my laptop without lifting my head.

                    After your hair gets long, you really understand that hair has no nerves. As long as the part being pressed is far from your head, you won't feel anything.

                    Someone even sat on my hair on the bus once, and I had time to think about whether to tell them or not.

                    If they get off before me, I just let them sit on it until they leave. It doesn't matter.

                    When I first step on it, it doesn't hurt. But when I try to stand up, it really hurts, and my head gets pulled suddenly so I lose my balance.

                    So I usually wrap my hair around my neck before squatting down.

                    When putting on pants or a skirt, my hair sometimes gets inside by accident. I just pull it out. It doesn't hurt.

                    But when taking off pants or a skirt, the nearby hair gets caught and pulled down with the waistband. That really hurts.

                    The best moment when combing hair with your hands is when it slides through your fingers at the end.

                    Now if I want to comb to the end with my hands, I have to let the hair go around my calf, then comb back up.
